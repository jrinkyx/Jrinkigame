# Jrinkigame
Indie pixel-art game project using Godot Engine. Personal learning and practice.
Making a game that works.

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 – Setup & Tools
- [x] Create GitHub repo `Jrinkigame`
- [ ] Initialize Godot project in this repo
- [ ] Set up folder structure (`assets/`, `scenes/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `art/`)
- [ ] Configure Godot to use VS Code as external editor
- [ ] Install and test core VS Code extensions (Git, GitLens, Godot Tools)

### Phase 1 – Learning & Prototype

- [ ] Implement movement (walk / run / jump depending on game type)
- [ ] Add basic collision (walls, ground)
- [ ] Add a simple camera that follows the player

### Phase 2 – Core Gameplay
- [ ] Decide on core game type (platformer / top-down / something else)
- [ ] Implement one core mechanic (attack, dash, double jump, etc.)
- [ ] Add at least one enemy or hazard
- [ ] Add win/lose condition (goal, death, restart)
- [ ] Create one small playable level from start to finish

### Phase 3 – Art, Audio & Polish
- [ ] Replace placeholder shapes with simple pixel art
- [ ] Add basic sound effects (jump, hit, UI clicks)
- [ ] Add background music
- [ ] Add simple animations (idle, walk, attack)
- [ ] Add pause menu and settings (at least volume / quit to main menu)

### Phase 4 – Build & Release
- [ ] Create export presets for Windows and macOS
- [ ] Build a playable demo
- [ ] Write a short description and screenshots for the game
- [ ] Share the build with friends / online for feedback
- [ ] Collect feedback and plan next iteration
